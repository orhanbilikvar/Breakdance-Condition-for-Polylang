# Adding Breakdance conditions for Polylang with the plugin
Adds the Polylang condition to the Breakdance Template and its elements.

Source code https://pastebin.com/aALYKZkU. I changed the "support" line to make the conditions work in the templates.

Usage
1- Open the zip file
2- Upload inside "wp-content/plugins/" folder
3- Activate the plugin from the wp admin panel
